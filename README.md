# todo-app

This is a basic todo list built with just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which stores the user's list in local storage for persistent functionality and auto-sorts todo items alphanumerically.

# Creating a new task

# Removing a newly created task

# Removing a completed task

# Clearing the todo list (clears local storage and reloads the page)

# Under the hood (what happens in local storage when creating/removing/updating tasks)

# Roadmap

- Adding a prompt to the Clear Task List button to ensure user definitely wants to reset their todo list
- Adding a calendar to the app
- Applying tasks to user-selected calendar days
- Storing todo lists in an external database (to not rely on local storage)
